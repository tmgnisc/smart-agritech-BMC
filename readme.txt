SmartAgri Tech

SmartAgri Tech, addresses the pressing challenges faced by Nepalese smallholder
farmers and commercial farmers, such as maintaining optimal density, humidity,
temperature, and environmental conditions lack of real-time data, and inefficient
irrigation practices.

With agriculture consuming over 90% of Nepal’s freshwater—30–50% lost to wasteful
methods—this IoT-based solution empowers farmers to optimize resources and
enhance productivity. By integrating soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air quality
sensors, SmartAgri delivers critical farm data to a microcontroller, which feeds a web
app for real-time monitoring.This enables farmers to make informed decisions, reducing
crop losses due to environmental stress. The semi-automatic irrigation system
minimizes labor while conserving water, and offline functionality ensures reliability in
remote areas with unstable internet. Tailored for small farms,

SmartAgri’s B2B model leverages partnerships for distribution, training, and support,
ensuring community-driven adoption to local municipalities who then handle and
monitor the whole system for farmers. Looking ahead, the solution aims to incorporate
AI-driven predictive analytics to anticipate weather patterns and optimize resource use,
alongside sustainable water management practices to reduce environmental impact. By
providing accessible, scalable technology, SmartAgri Tech fosters a smarter, greener
future for Nepalese agriculture, empowering farmers to improve food security and
livelihoods while addressing the challenges of climate change and resource scarcity in
rural communities.
